### Project Description
S3h2 converts modern english into shakespeare's very own!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Given the era in which the wonderful works of Shakespeare are often looked by our generation(primarily due to having to study it as part of a syllabus- yuck), we at DECODERS decided to
bring forth the romanticism and the infamous literary style of the Shakespearean age.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
It's fun. Shakespeare is fun...if you can understand it. Perhaps not understanding it and having to sit there decoding it IS the fun. Nevertheless, we wished to emulate that magic by
making a translator that translates modern english to shakespearean english!
